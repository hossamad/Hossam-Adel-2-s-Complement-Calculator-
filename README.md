# Hossam-Adel-2's Complement Calculator using Unate Recursive Complement Algorithm
the UnateRecursiveComplement.c file is the C source file of the program, and 
the other files are different boolean functions with different sizes that you can use to test the program.


description:
1)	the algorithm divides the Boolean function into smaller pieces until termination conditions are met.
2)	The Boolean functions are represented in cube list representation
3)	Unate Boolean function means that each var appears in one polarity only.
