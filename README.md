# Hossam-Adel-2's Complement Calculator using Unate Recursive Complement Algorithm
the UnateRecursiveComplement.c file is the C source file of the program, and 
the other files are different boolean functions with different sizes that you can use to test the program.


description:
1)	If the Boolean function (or cube list) isn’t unate , then the algorithm divides it into smaller pieces until it becomes unate, and then use the termination rules .
2)	The Boolean functions are represented in cube list representation
3)	Unate Boolean function means that each var appears in one polarity only.
4)	termination conditions are:
      don’t care term appear the cube list
      one of Boolean algebra rules is met
